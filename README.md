# BFH — Bergfreunde Harness for Pi

BFH is a [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) extension for turning a Jira ticket into a reviewed draft pull request.

Humans steer, agents execute: you provide the ticket, acceptance criteria, and repository context; BFH gives the agent a small, enforced workflow so the work stays reliable, reviewable, and easier to improve next time.

You start it from the repository you want to change:

```text
/bfh PC-120
```

BFH then creates a state file under `.pi/bfh/`, guides the agent through scouting, implementation, review, PR creation, and retrospective notes, and keeps the important evidence on disk instead of only in chat.

Repository: [github.com/bergthorsten/bfh](https://github.com/bergthorsten/bfh)

## What You Get

- A step-by-step workflow for Jira ticket work.
- A local state file for every ticket: `.pi/bfh/<TICKET>.state.json`.
- A read-only scout pass before implementation.
- A fresh review pass before closing.
- Close gates for tests, review evidence, and draft PR creation.
- A short retrospective trail with auto-derived run insights and staged harness amendments.

The short version:

```text
intake -> scout -> clarify? -> implement -> verify_review -> close -> pr_review -> retro -> done
```

Set difficulty at start with `--level 1|2|3` (default **2**):

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Easy / hands-off — internal human checkpoints bypassed (no `human_gate`). |
| **2** | Medium (default) — agent decides when to clarify or ask the human. |
| **3** | Hard — mandatory design review after scout (2–3 options → human choice → proposal → accept/decline) before implement. |

Per-level implementer model hints ship with the package (override in repo-root `config.jsonc` or env `BFH_IMPLEMENT_MODEL_L1`–`L3`).

## Prerequisites

Install these before installing BFH:

1. **Node.js 22 or newer**

   Check your version:

   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

   If the version is below `v22.0.0`, install a newer Node.js version first.

2. **Pi**

   ```bash
   npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
   ```

3. **Pi subagents**

   BFH uses subagents for scout and review steps.

   ```bash
   pi install npm:pi-subagents
   ```

4. **GitHub CLI for PR creation**

   This is only needed for the close/PR step.

   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```

   If you are not logged in, run:

   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

## Install BFH

The fastest install path is:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bergthorsten/bfh/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

The installer checks for Node.js 22+, installs Pi, installs `pi-subagents`, and installs BFH from the latest GitHub release.

Published GitHub releases automatically upload the repository's root `install.sh` as the `install.sh` release asset used by this URL.

If you prefer to run the Pi install manually:

```bash
latest_url="$(curl -fsSLI -o /dev/null -w '%{url_effective}' https://github.com/bergthorsten/bfh/releases/latest)"
latest_tag="${latest_url##*/}"
pi install "git:github.com/bergthorsten/bfh@${latest_tag}"
```

If no release exists yet, install from the current development branch instead:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/bergthorsten/bfh
```

### Local Installer Script

This repository includes the same helper script for local development:

```bash
./install.sh
```

It does not install Node.js for you because Node installation differs by operating system and version manager. Install Node 22+ first, then run the script.

## Configure BFH

BFH reads repo-local settings from **`config.jsonc`** at the repository root (JSON with comments). This file is **gitignored** — the installer or first `/bfh` copies `config.example.jsonc` from the package.

```jsonc
{
  "jira": {
    "baseUrl": "https://portal.bergfreunde.de/jira",
    // "token": "…",  // or export JIRA_TOKEN for CI
    "authMode": "bearer"
  },
  "workflow": {
    "defaultDifficulty": 2,
    "baseBranch": "main"
  },
}
```

Model defaults ship with the BFH package (see commented block in `config.example.jsonc`). Uncomment `models` in `config.jsonc` only to override.

Environment variables override file values (useful for secrets in CI): `JIRA_TOKEN`, `JIRA_BASE_URL`, `BFH_BASE_BRANCH`, `JIRA_ACCEPTANCE_FIELDS`, `JIRA_CONSTRAINT_FIELDS`, and model env vars `BFH_IMPLEMENT_MODEL_L1`–`L3`.

Optional: commit `config.example.jsonc` in your app repo with team workflow defaults (no tokens).

If you only want to try BFH without Jira, use `--no-jira`.

## Your First Run

1. Open the repository where the ticket should be implemented.

   ```bash
   cd ~/devenv/my-project
   pi
   ```

2. Start BFH with a Jira ticket key.

   ```text
   /bfh PC-120
   ```

3. Review the kickoff prompt.

   Pi opens a prepared prompt in the editor. Add useful context, for example:

   ```text
   Focus on checkout timeout in @src/Service/Checkout/PaymentHandler.php
   Repro: POST /api/checkout, see @tests/Integration/CheckoutTest.php
   Do not modify @src/Legacy/
   ```

4. Press **Enter** to start.

5. Check progress at any time:

   ```text
   /bfh-status PC-120
   ```

6. Resume later if needed:

   ```text
   /bfh-resume PC-120
   ```

## Common Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/bfh <KEY>` | Start a new ticket run. |
| `/bfh <KEY> --go` | Start immediately without editing the kickoff prompt. |
| `/bfh <KEY> --no-jira` | Start with only the ticket key, no Jira lookup. |
| `/bfh <KEY> --level 1\|2\|3` | Difficulty (default 2). Level 1 = hands-off; level 3 = mandatory design review. |
| `/bfh-status [KEY\|path]` | Show the current state summary. |
| `/bfh-list` | List BFH state files in this repository. |
| `/bfh-resume [KEY\|path]` | Continue an existing run. |
| `/bfh-scout [KEY\|path]` | Run the scout subagent when the state is in `scout`. |
| `/bfh-verify [KEY\|path]` | Run the review gate when the state is in `verify_review`. |
| `/bfh-close [KEY\|path]` | Run close gates and create or reuse a draft PR. |
| `/bfh-pr-sync [KEY\|path]` | Sync GitHub PR review status into BFH state. |
| `/bfh-retro [KEY\|path]` | Write retrospective notes and proposed harness amendments. |
| `/bfh-selftest` | Run the local BFH smoke test inside Pi. |

## How The Workflow Feels

### 1. Intake

BFH reads the Jira ticket, creates `.pi/bfh/<TICKET>.state.json`, writes a short brief, and prepares the kickoff prompt.

### 2. Scout

The agent investigates before editing. Scout output records relevant files, commands, patterns, and risks in the state file.

### 3. Clarify + Human Pre-Implement Checkpoint (Optional)

If there are real decision points, the agent asks targeted questions and records them in state. You can explicitly approve before implementation starts.

### 4. Implement

The agent makes the code change. Test evidence should be recorded before review. Close gates later require passing evidence and marker files written by BFH.

### 5. Verify And Review

BFH runs a fresh review pass. Outcomes are:

- `approved`: move forward to close.
- `needs_revision`: go back to implementation, up to the revision limit.
- `failed`: stop when the revision budget is exhausted or the review cannot pass.

### 6. Close (Human Pre-Close Approval Required)

BFH checks the state, test markers, review markers, human pre-close approval, and working tree. If everything is ready, it can create a draft PR with `gh`.

You can set the base branch explicitly:

```bash
export BFH_BASE_BRANCH="main"
```

### 7. PR Review And Retro

After a draft PR exists, BFH can sync GitHub review status and only move to `done` after approval unless explicitly overridden. The retro step now auto-derives compact insights (for example revision-loop usage, missing test evidence, and PR review bounce-back), appends them to `LEARNINGS.md`, and stages a structured amendment proposal when requested.

## Files BFH Writes

For a ticket like `PC-120`, expect files like:

```text
.pi/bfh/PC-120.state.json
.pi/bfh/PC-120.brief.md
.pi/bfh/PC-120/tested.json
.pi/bfh/PC-120/reviewed.json
.pi/bfh/PC-120/manual-tested.json
.pi/bfh/PC-120/working-memory.json
.pi/bfh/PC-120/pr-review.json
config.jsonc
config.example.jsonc
.pi/bfh/principles.md
.pi/bfh/README.md
.pi/bfh/amendments/
```

The state schema lives in `bfh-state.schema.json`.

## Local Development

Run the deterministic smoke test:

```bash
bun run selftest
```

Validate the state schema:

```bash
bun run validate:schema
```

Run the full local check:

```bash
bun run check
```

## Repository Layout

```text
bfh/
  package.json
  bfh-state.schema.json
  install.sh
  agents/
    scout.md
    reviewer.md
    closer.md
    retrospective.md
  extensions/lean_bfh/
    index.ts
    commands.ts
    tool.ts
    state.ts
    jira.ts
    subagent.ts
    close.ts
    kickoff.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

### `node --version` is below 22

Install Node.js 22 or newer, then rerun the install steps.

### `pi: command not found`

Install Pi:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

Then open a new shell and try:

```bash
pi --help
```

### Jira lookup fails

Check `JIRA_BASE_URL` and `JIRA_TOKEN`, or start without Jira:

```text
/bfh PC-120 --no-jira
```

### PR creation fails

Check that `gh` is installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh auth status
```

Also make sure you have permission to push the current branch and that the working tree is clean before close.

## Design Principles

- State on disk beats memory in chat.
- Humans steer; agents execute.
- Phase transitions are enforced by code.
- Review runs with fresh context.
- The kickoff is a map, not a manual: add only the concrete file and repo context the agent needs.
- Instructions decay; enforcement persists.
- Knowledge compounds across runs through retrospectives and harness amendments.
